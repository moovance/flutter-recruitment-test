- Create a class named `RouteRecorder` and implement a method allowing to
aggregate location data and acceleration data into a single object

- You can start working from the `route_recorder.dart` file that already contains an empty `RouteRecorder` class

- `LocationData` and `AccelerationData` will both be provided by the `LocationService` and `AccelerometerService` respectively

- You don't need to implement `LocationService` or `AccelerometerService`
